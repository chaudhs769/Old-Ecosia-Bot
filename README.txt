INSTALL PyAutoGui and pyscreeze!!

If it doesn't work automatically, you should open 'Snipping Tool' and take pictures similar to the ones you see in the folder.
It's 'Searchbar.PNG' that is most likely to cause any problems, or if you have a theme installed that's not white.

REMEMBER if you change the file name(s), the name(s) must match 100% also the .png/PNG
