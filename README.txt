INSTALL PyAutoGui and pyscreeze!!

If the bot does not work automatically by it self, you should open 'Snipping Tool' and take pictures similar to the ones you see in the folder, except for the 'example.PNG'.
It's most likely the 'Searchbar.PNG' picture, that is most likely to cause any problems, because of the re-scaling from pc to pc.
You WILL have to put the Ecosia extension in the chrome menu, if you don't see it click the three bullets at the right top. (See example.PNG, for more details)

REMEMBER if you change the file name(s), the name(s) must match 100% also the .png extension.
Keep all of the files in one folder!

Note: If you've got a black theme installed onto chrome, you can change the 'Ecosia2.png' to 'Ecosia.PNG' for higher accuracy.

# If you choose to clear your search history, your planted trees counter will be reset, though you have still planted trees, unless you tick the 'Cookies and other website data' off.
